# 'BECOME A QA AUTOMATION' - Week-14 - Automation Test

This project consists of Automated UI tests based on WebdriverIO framework to test the Login and Register forms I created on [Week 9.](https://github.com/Micaela-89/Problematica-9)

## Description
The tests were made with WebdriverIO based on Jasmine framework and in synchronous mode.

I created tests for:
- The login form (with valid and invalid credentials, redirecting to register page).
- The register form (with valid and invalid credentials, redirecting to login page).

## Technology stack 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/docs/) (At least version 12 is necessary)
* [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for starting a local server
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) so that ECMASCRIPT6 could be supported.
* Visual Studio Code (or other code editor is necessary)
* Google chrome (preferred)
* 
## Installation 
**After downloading the project from this repository, the following procedures are needed before tests can be run:**

 (You should use the following commands, either on the git or on the VS console)

* Run *Git Bash* on the project's folder (could be other terminal)
* Run *code .* (to open the files in Visual Studio Code)
* Run *npm install* (to install every dependency of the package.json)

## Runing tests
* First, the server should be started, running the comand *npm start* ( on a terminal, for example on the VS Code terminal).
* To run the tests, you should use the command *npm run test* on the Git terminal.
